### Hi there 👋
I'm Ben, a software engineer based in Tokyo. I primarily work on web development projects, but I'm also always looking for ways to learn more and explore different areas of software engineering and programming.

Here's some info on what I've been up to lately in the coding world...

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  * [Code Duel](https://github.com/webbben/code-duel) - A "competitive coding" platform of sorts. Basically, a site where you can face off with friends over leetcode-style coding challenges, under a time constraint.
    * In "beta", available here: https://code-duel-mu.vercel.app/
  * Trending job data for software engineering - I've made a python script that scrapes linkedin job postings once a month, and compiles the most frequently appearing tech-related keywords and terms. While it gathers data, I'm also slowly working on an app to visualize the data trends. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  * Golang! I've been exploring the world of backend development a bit deeper, and learning Go as I go (ha).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  * Cool open source projects, especially if they use Go, since I'm wanting to get more real world experience there.
